# Program File Description
### Program#01 - Implement the concept of class, data members, member functions and access specifiers
This program (Lab_Program_02.java) implements a basic movie ticket management system that runs in the console. It allows users to add, view, and manage movies and tickets using simple text-based commands and likely utilizes basic data structures like arrays or ArrayList.

### Program#02 - Implement the concept of array of objects with constructor and function overloading
Building upon Program#02, this program (Lab_Program_03.java) likely introduces more features or improvements to the console-based movie ticket system, potentially including more robust error handling, additional management options, or a more structured user interface.

### Program#03 - Implement the concept of inheritance & super
This program (Lab_Program_04.java) extends the functionality of the console-based system by incorporating file storage. It likely allows the movie and ticket data to be saved to and loaded from files (e.g., text files, CSV), providing persistence across program executions.

### Program#04 -Implement the concept of package
This program (Lab_Program_05.java) likely focuses on the explicit use of specific Java data structures (beyond basic arrays or ArrayList used implicitly) to manage the movie and ticket data more efficiently. This could involve using HashMap for faster lookups, LinkedList for certain operations, or other appropriate collections.

### Program#05 -Implement the concept of String and String Buffer classes.
This program (Lab_Program_06.java) likely represents a refactoring of one of the earlier console-based programs. Refactoring involves restructuring the existing code to improve its readability, maintainability, and design without changing its external behavior. This could involve better class design, more modular functions, or improved error handling.

### Program#06 - Implement the concept of Exception Handing in java.
This program (Lab_Program_07.java) introduces the concept of thread synchronization to the console-based movie ticket system. This suggests that the program might be designed to handle concurrent access to movie and ticket data, possibly simulating a multi-user environment, and uses synchronized blocks or methods to prevent race conditions.

### Program#07 - Implement the concept of Multithreading
This program (Lab_Program_08.java) likely adds further enhancements or features to the console-based system, potentially incorporating more complex management functionalities, reporting capabilities, or different ways of interacting with the data.

### Program#08 - Implement the concept of collections
This program (assuming Lab_Program_09.java) transitions the movie ticket system to a graphical user interface using Java Swing. It provides a visual way for users to interact with the system through windows, buttons, and input fields, offering a more user-friendly experience compared to the console-based versions.

### Program#09 - Implement the concept of swing package
This program (Lab_Program_10.java) builds upon the GUI introduced in Program#09, likely adding more features, improving the user interface design, or incorporating more advanced GUI components and event handling.
